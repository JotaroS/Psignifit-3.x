- Python interface
- setup.py
- beta binomial models
- Implement alternative SimplexAlgorithm (Numerical Recipes?)
- Sensitivity analysis
- Goodness of fit (Correlations?)                                          [OK] but correlations are wrong
- More Sigmoids (gumbel, weibull, gauss, ...)
- BCa confidence limits for slope and widths
- Unit test with gamma as a free parameter                                 [OK] but only very rough correspondence to psignifit should be stricter

     implement dlposteri und dnegllikeli                                   [OK]
     check hybrid MCMC versus MH-MCMC                                      [OK]
     can we put both MCMC strategies together to have the same base class? [OK]
