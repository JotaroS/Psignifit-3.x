- Implement alternative SimplexAlgorithm
- Sensitivity analysis
- Goodness of fit (Correlations?)
- More Sigmoids (gumbel, weibull, gauss, ...)
- BCa confidence limits for slope and widths
- Unit test with gamma as a free parameter                                 [OK] but only very rough correspondence to psignifit should be stricter

+ Unit test for mwCore                                                     [OK]
+ Outliers and Influential observations                                    [OK]
+ MCMC
     implement dlposteri und dnegllikeli                                   [OK]
     check hybrid MCMC versus MH-MCMC                                      [OK]
     can we put both MCMC strategies together to have the same base class? [OK]
+ Documentation                                                            [OK]
+ pointer arithmetic for datasets                                          [OK]
- beta binomial models
