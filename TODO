- Python interface
- setup.py
- Implement alternative SimplexAlgorithm (Numerical Recipes?)
- beta binomial models
- BCa confidence limits for slope (and widths?)
- Sensitivity analysis
- Goodness of fit (Correlations?)                                          [OK] but correlations are wrong
- Unit test with gamma as a free parameter                                 [OK] but only very rough correspondence to psignifit -- should be stricter

+ More Sigmoids (gumbel, weibull, gauss, ...)                              [OK] at least for now
+ log-core to allow fitting data on log contrast (i.e. gumbel to weibull)  [OK]
+ unit tests for logCore and linearCore                                    [OK]
+ linear core ax+b                                                         [OK]
+ Unit test for mwCore                                                     [OK]
+ Outliers and Influential observations                                    [OK]
+ MCMC
     implement dlposteri und dnegllikeli                                   [OK]
     check hybrid MCMC versus MH-MCMC                                      [OK]
     can we put both MCMC strategies together to have the same base class? [OK]
+ Documentation                                                            [OK]
+ pointer arithmetic for datasets                                          [OK]
