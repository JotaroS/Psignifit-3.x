- Make sure that sscanf does not use locale for Numbers!
- Check when we need #include <numpy/arrayobject.h> and when #include <Numeric/arrayobject.h>
- use linalg.h/linalg.cc for Psychometric::leastfavourable and for Sampler class
    - leastfavourable                                                     [OK]
    - sampler class doesn't work, why?
- high level python interface:
    - unit tests
    - refactor the python toolbox to have "strict" data objects and plot functions working on top of these
    - Convergence diagnostics for MCMC
    - posterior intervals and posterior histograms for model parameters
- mid level python interface:
    - migrate to boost-python?
- MCMC: Use fisher matrix as covariance matrix for the proposal distribution
- nonparametric bootstrap
- Implement alternative SimplexAlgorithm (Numerical Recipes?, gsl-Wrapper-Object?) The current one depends heavily on the initial simplex!
    - Perform some gradient based steps after simplex optimization (doesn't work good)
    - alternative: Perform some gradient based steps as a special case of simplex optimization (e.g. particularly good points are moved in the direction of the gradient?)
- beta binomial models
- BCa confidence limits for slope (and widths?)
- Sensitivity analysis
- Goodness of fit (Correlations?)                                          [OK] but correlations are wrong
- Unit test with gamma as a free parameter                                 [OK] but only very rough correspondence to psignifit -- should be stricter

     check hybrid MCMC versus MH-MCMC                                      [OK]
     can we put both MCMC strategies together to have the same base class? [OK]

+ low level Python interface
	+ generate some functions that perform the parameter parsing -- the code is really ugly in its current state
	+ bootstrap, missing:
		+ return BCa stuff                                                [OK] but is this what we wanted?
        + return correlations and outliers
		+ many python functions return new references. Not all of them are
		  properly dereferenced yet.
	+ ML/MAP-estimate separately
	+ MCMC
    + evaluation, deviance and deviance residuals
