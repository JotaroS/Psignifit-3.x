- enable symmetric priors i.e. gamma==lambda
- seed the random number generator
- Goodness of fit (Correlations?)                                          [OK] but correlations are wrong
- Unit test with gamma as a free parameter                                 [OK] but only very rough correspondence to psignifit -- should be stricter
- BCa confidence limits for slope (and widths?)
- Bugs with different cores -> no convergence, exceptionally high deviance with ok looking fit, ... This is only due to the logCore-Kernel that returns -inf for contrasts of 0
- use linalg.h/linalg.cc for Sampler class

MayBe:
- implement fullmodel, nullmodel
- Implement alternative SimplexAlgorithm (Numerical Recipes?, gsl-Wrapper-Object?) The current one depends heavily on the initial simplex!
    - Perform some gradient based steps after simplex optimization (doesn't work good)
    - alternative: Perform some gradient based steps as a special case of simplex optimization (e.g. particularly good points are moved in the direction of the gradient?)
- MCMC: Use fisher matrix as covariance matrix for the proposal distribution
