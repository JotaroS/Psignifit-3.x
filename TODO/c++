- influential observations should be marked graded with a value < 1 indicating influential observations. How to do that for the ci based bootstrap strategy?
- beta binomial models
- implement fullmodel, nullmodel
- Goodness of fit (Correlations?)                                          [OK] but correlations are wrong
- Unit test with gamma as a free parameter                                 [OK] but only very rough correspondence to psignifit -- should be stricter
- BCa confidence limits for slope (and widths?)
- Implement alternative SimplexAlgorithm (Numerical Recipes?, gsl-Wrapper-Object?) The current one depends heavily on the initial simplex!
    - Perform some gradient based steps after simplex optimization (doesn't work good)
    - alternative: Perform some gradient based steps as a special case of simplex optimization (e.g. particularly good points are moved in the direction of the gradient?)
- MCMC: Use fisher matrix as covariance matrix for the proposal distribution
- use linalg.h/linalg.cc for Sampler class
- Bugs with different cores -> no convergence, exceptionally high deviance with ok looking fit, ... This is only due to the logCore-Kernel that returns -inf for contrasts of 0
- NaN in bootstrap
- Alternate seeds. This might solve problems with optimizers, too. Strategy:
    determine upper and lower bounds for alpha and beta and search the area spanned by these two on a 10x10 grid.
    range for alpha: Determine the data point with the lowest %-correct (x_l) and the data point with the highest %-correct (x_h).
        then alpha should be larger than x_l-(x_h-x_l) and less than x_h+(x_h-x_l).
    upper bound for beta/w: The psychometric function should not be shallower than rising on the whole range for alpha.
    lower bound for beta/w: will probably have to be set to a relatively arbitrary value.
