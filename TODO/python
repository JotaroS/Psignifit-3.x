- Sensitivity analysis
- what is going on with type checking in psigniplot.GoodnessOfFit?
- add a dictionary to the data objects to make them know what they are (stimulus intensity, ...)
- Like ParameterPlot but for thresholds
- move numbers further away from the axes.                            [OK]
