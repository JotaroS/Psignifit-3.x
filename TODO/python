- enable fixing the guessing rate to an arbitrary value (? which?)        <- This is actually possible by putting a strong prior on the guessing rate...
- proposal distribution for parameters in initial fit should be somehow related to the parameter size and the expected variability
- what is going on with type checking in psigniplot.GoodnessOfFit?
- add a dictionary to the data objects to make them know what they are (stimulus intensity, ...)
- ROC curves for 1AFC
