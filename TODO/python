- Plotting function for only data and fit or fitting data and fit separately ~> refactoring?
- axes should incompass all measurements and the whole range of the CI
- plotting example for multiple PMFs should also show how to display CI
- out of bounds for CI: arrow and a number for the end.
- python setup install works on Mac
- enable fixing the guessing rate to an arbitrary value (? which?)        <- This is actually possible by putting a strong prior on the guessing rate...
- proposal distribution for parameters in initial fit should be somehow related to the parameter size and the expected variability
- what is going on with type checking in psigniplot.GoodnessOfFit?
- add a dictionary to the data objects to make them know what they are (stimulus intensity, ...)
- ROC curves for 1AFC
