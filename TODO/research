- Determine a prior that is "flat in function space" i.e. with flat slope. Can we feed back the derivative information to determine this prior analytically?
- What kind of convergence test can we perform on posterior deviance (comparison to full model, null model, ...  ~> Carl Rasmussen, Cambridge)
- Blockwise adaptive
