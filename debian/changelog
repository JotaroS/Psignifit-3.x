psignifit (3.0~beta.20120309.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bumped standards version from 3.9.2 to 3.9.3, no changes required
  * Bumped the copyright year.
  * Revised debian changelog at the request of Michael Hanke
  * This is a combined bugfix and feature release.
  * The toolbox was refactored to support compilation as a static library. The
    Python wrappers are linked against this static library
  * Experimental support for modelling with Jeffrey's prior. Documentation to
    follow. Jeffrey's prior is a noninformative prior that is invariant with
    respect to a number of transformations. Jeffrey's prior can not be applied
    to a single parameter. There is now a new psychometric function object
    that uses Jeffrey's prior.
  * The Bayesian posterior when using ASIR was too narrow. As
    it turned out, these problems were mainly related to some of the prior
    distributions that were evaluated at undefined points. This is now fixed
  * Our releases are now tagges with signed git tags signed by Ingo Fr체nd
    (0x3614F9D9). This allows anyone who has signed this key to verify that
    the release tag was actually created by Ingo Fr체nd.
  * We also revised the format for the tags. Before we were using
    snap-YYYY-MM-YY. Now we use release/3.0_beta.YYYYMMDD.N, where N can be
    used to mark multiple releases on the same day.
  * Lastly there were a large number of minor typos and trivial fixes.
